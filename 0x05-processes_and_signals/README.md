Processes and signals

In this project I am going to tackle about Process and Signals tasks.

What is Process?
-A process is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a program.
Each process is guaranteed a process identification number (PID).

    What is PID?
A PID (i.e., process identification number) is an identification number that is automatically assigned to each process when it is created on a Unix-like operating system.

What is Signals?
-In simpler terms Signal is a software interupts.
