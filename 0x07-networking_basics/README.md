## OSI model
##### What is OSI model?
Definitions:
* OSI model is a conceptual model(A conceptual model is a representation of a system, made of the composition of concepts which are used to help people know, understand, or simulate a subject the model represents.) that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.
* The Open Systems Interconnection (ISO) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.
##### How many layers it has?
* OSI models has seven layers.
##### How is it organized?
An OSI model consists of seven different layers which are typically described from  top to bottom. In order from seven to one, the layers are as follows:
* 7. Application Layer
* 6. Presentation Layer
* 5. Session Layer
* 4. Transport Layer
* 3. Network Layer
* 2. Data Link Layer
* 1. Physical Layer

## What is a LAN?
* A Local Area Network(LAN) connects network devices over a relatively short distance.
##### Usage:
* LANs are typically used in private households or in companies to set up home or corporate networks.
##### Technologies Used:
* Ethernet
* Token Ring
## What is a WAN?
* A WAN is a geographically-dispersed collection of LANs. A network device called a router connects LANs to a WAN - In IP networking, the router maintains both a LAN address and a WAN address.
##### Usage:
* WANs can facilitate communication, the sharing of information and much more between devices from around the world through a WAN provider.
##### Technologies Used:
* ATM
* Frame Relay
* X.25
- Theses technologies are used for connectivity over the longer distances.
## What is the Internet?
##### Definitions:
* The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.
* It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
## TCP/UDP
##### What is TCP?
* Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, standard Internet communications protocols that allow digital computers to communicate over long distances.
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, standard Internet communications protocols that allow digital computers to communicate over long distances - CP provides apps a way to deliver (and receive) an ordered and error-checked stream of information packets over the network.
##### What is UDP?
* User Datagram Protocal(UDP) â€“ a communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network - It's an alternative to the transmission control protocol (TCP). User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used by apps to deliver a faster stream of information by doing away with error-checking.
