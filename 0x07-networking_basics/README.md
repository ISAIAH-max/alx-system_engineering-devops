## OSI model
##### What is OSI model?
Definitions:
* OSI model is a conceptual model(A conceptual model is a representation of a system, made of the composition of concepts which are used to help people know, understand, or simulate a subject the model represents.) that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.
* The Open Systems Interconnection (ISO) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.
##### How many layers it has?
* OSI models has seven layers.
##### How is it organized?
An OSI model consists of seven different layers which are typically described from  top to bottom. In order from seven to one, the layers are as follows:
* 7. Application Layer
* 6. Presentation Layer
* 5. Session Layer
* 4. Transport Layer
* 3. Network Layer
* 2. Data Link Layer
* 1. Physical Layer

## What is a LAN?
* A Local Area Network(LAN) connects network devices over a relatively short distance.
##### Usage:
* LANs are typically used in private households or in companies to set up home or corporate networks.
## What is a WAN?
* A Wide Area Network(WAN) spans a large physical distance.
##### Usage:
* The internet is the largest WAN, spanning the Earth.
